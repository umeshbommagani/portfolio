                I am currently pursuing my MSIT at IIIT Hyderabad, where I am sharpening my expertise in programming and web development. I have a solid command of languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and have a good understanding of operating systems and Git. My passion lies in creating efficient and scalable solutions while adhering to best practices in both front-end and back-end development.

Outside of coding, I enjoy organizing events and traveling in my free time, which helps me build leadership skills and explore new perspectives. I'm always eager to learn, adapt, and contribute to exciting projects that challenge me both technically and creatively.
